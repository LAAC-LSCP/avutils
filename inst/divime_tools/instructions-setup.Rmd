These are instructions for getting the app to work.

To use the DiViMe tools, you'll need access to at least `vagrant`. Since you managed to install the tool set this should be available by default. 

The other tools are required for:

  - `sox`: audio manipulation (split files, get audio info) [not yet implemented]
  
  - `ffmpeg`: extract audio from video [not yet implemented]
  
  - `git`: install and/or update VM [not yet implemented]
  
Chances are you have `git` available, but not necessarily `sox` and `ffmpeg`. For now this doesn't matter, so you can ignore their absence.

Next, you should set the location of your DiViMe VM, i.e. 'the DiViMe folder', which contains all the tools.

Finally, you need to select the folder with your audio files. Once this is done, you can check the tabs under `utilities` to see the folder content and any output files generated by DiViMe.

If you run this app for the first time, it's probably a good idea to check out the `tests` tab, which let's you check whether `vagrant` works and in which state your VM is. Here, you can also run the DiViMe test script. Note that this takes a while to finish. It's also probably a good idea to clear out the `data` folder in your DiViMe folder after you ran this test.
