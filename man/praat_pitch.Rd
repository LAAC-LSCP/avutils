\usage{
praat_pitch(sound_file, child = TRUE, time_range = NULL,
  pathtopraat = NULL, unit = "Hertz", pathtosox = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sound_file}{character, path to audio file}

\item{child}{logical, should pitch settings be set for child (default),
or adult}

\item{time_range}{numeric of length 2, optional start and end time in
seconds. If left blank (\code{NULL}) the entire file is processed.}

\item{pathtopraat}{character, the path to the Praat binary}

\item{unit}{character, the unit for the frequency measures (\code{"Hertz"},
\code{"ERB"}, ...)}

\item{pathtosox}{character, optional path to sox binary (only required if
\code{time_range} is \emph{not} \code{NULL})}
}
\value{
a data frame with one row
}
\description{
extract some pitch variables via Praat from audio (segments)
}
\details{
The output reflects measures of F0 (actually, pitch): mean, 5%
percentile and 95% percentile.

The pitch settings for child versus adult are the following. Child:
floor = 150 Hz, ceiling = 650 Hz. Adult: floor = 75 Hz, ceiling = 400 Hz.
Time step for both is 0.01 s.

For this function to work, you need Praat, and you need to know where the
\code{Praat} binary is located. On a Mac the location is likely to be
"/Applications/Praat.app/Contents/MacOS/Praat", and on Windows
"C:/Program Files/Praat.exe".

The function produces and executes a short Praat script:

\code{Read from file: "myfile.wav"}

\code{To Pitch: 0.01, 150, 600}

\code{Get total duration}

\code{Get mean: 0, 0, "ERB"}

\code{Get quantile: 0, 0, 0.95, "ERB"}

\code{Get quantile: 0, 0, 0.05, "ERB"}

The second line is adapted according to whether the assigned speaker of the
audio segment is a child (as in the example above) or an adult (in which case
that line will be \code{To Pitch: 0.01, 75, 400})
}

            pathtopraat = ploc, pathtosox = sloc)
}
